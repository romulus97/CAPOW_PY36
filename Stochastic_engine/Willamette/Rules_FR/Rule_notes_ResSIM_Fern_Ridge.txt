Fern Ridge specifics:
4 RO gates - max capacity based on pool elevation and gate setting
6 spillway gates -  max capacity based on pool elevation and gate setting
1 Sluice gate-  max capacity based on pool elevation and gate setting
Tailwater elevation - 374m
Release allocation is sequential - 1st power plant - 2nd RO, 3rd Spill



Note 2_06_2013:  The sluice gate is the lowest priority sequentially, but could be used to augment flow slightly. Implementation of this gate will be tricky (since it would be the 2nd priority below the spillway elevation and 3rd above it.  Also, the amount of additional release capacity provided is ~10% at low flows diminishing to ~2.5% at high flows.
