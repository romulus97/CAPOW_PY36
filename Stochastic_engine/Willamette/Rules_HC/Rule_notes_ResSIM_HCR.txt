Hills Creek Dam

Top of Dam - 0
HCR power max release - Linear - Max - var:pool elevation
HCR special curves - IRRM - Linear - induced surcharge falling pool (release average inflow over the last 48h)
HCR min power - Linear - Minimum - var:pool elevation
Spill during gate tracking - Linear - Minimum - var: special curves min flow and current release (cms)
*make sure RO flow has min gate*  If RO flow > 0:
     Min RO Flow - linear - minimum - var: pool elev
FloodIncrsRate_HillsCrk - Step - increasing - var:release

Low Turbine Flows at low reservoir elevation - linear - specified - var:net inflow
Low RO Flows When Turbine low - linear - specified - var: net inflow

Hills Creek specifics:
2 power plant gates - max capacity based on pool elev
2 RO gates - max capacity - max capacity based on pool elevation and gate setting
3 spillway gates -  max capacity based on pool elevation and gate setting
Tailwater elevation - 374m
Release allocation is sequential - 1st power plant - 2nd RO, 3rd Spillway
