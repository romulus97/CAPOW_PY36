FloodDcrseRate_CottGrv:  Linear - decreasing - var:release
FloodIncrsRate_CottGrv:  Constant - Increasing
Max Evacuation Release:  Linear - Max - var:pool elevation

Flood Control - 1
COT Special Curves:  induced surcharge falling pool (release average inflow over the last 24h)
Min flow from Cottage Grove:  step - minimum - var:date
FloodDcrseRate_CottGrv:  Linear - decreasing - var:release
FloodIncrsRate_CottGrv:  Constant - Increasing

Conservation - 2
Min flow from Cottage Grove:   step - minimum - var:date
Max Con Flow - at Cottage Grove:   step - maximum - var:date
Maximum Daily rate of increase from WCM:   Linear - maximum var:release lagged 24h
Daily BiOp Max Rate of Decrease:   Linear - minimum var:release lagged 24h  
       (Chooses the lesser of 1' per day tailwater change or a 50% reduction in flow per the BiOp.  This rule is for daily time step runs, not hourly time step runs.)

Cottage Grove Specifics
3 RO gates: max capacity based on gate setting and pool elevation
Spillway:  Max capacity based on Pool elevation
Outflow sequential:  RO then spillway
